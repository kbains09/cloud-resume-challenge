      <h2>Overview of My Experience</h2>
      <p>
        I am a versatile developer with experience in both front-end and back-end development. I specialize in building user-friendly interfaces using modern technologies such as React, HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, while also having a strong command of back-end technologies like Node.js, Express.js, and RESTful APIs. Additionally, I have hands-on experience with cloud platforms including AWS, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure, where I manage deployments and cloud infrastructure. I work proficiently with programming languages like Python, JavaScript, and Terraform for infrastructure automation. Moreover, I have experience working with relational databases such as PostgreSQL and NoSQL databases like MongoDB.
