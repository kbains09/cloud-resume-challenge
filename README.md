# cloud-resume-challenge

I'm taking on the Cloud Resume Challenge to build and deploy a cloud-based resume website. For my project, Iâ€™m using a monorepo with a React front end styled with SCSS and a Node.js/Express backend. I'm containerizing the entire app with Docker and deploying it on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
